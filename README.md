# codefundo_project
Our idea is to build a mobile app.

# Features:
# 1. Prediction:
* Bullet list
The data about the natural disaster will be fed to the app.
* Bullet list
That data will be used for training and getting a learned model.
* Bullet list
The users locations will be accesses by the GPS available on the mobile.
* Bullet list
The data from online news will be used as a test data for the model to predict whether the user's current location is prone to any kind of natural calamity.
* Bullet list
The online weather forecast will be taken into consideration. 

# 2. Alert:
* Bullet list
Once the prediction is positive the user will get an SMS alert of the danger.
* Bullet list
Some measures will also be given to the user for safety.
* Bullet list
Before the user starts using the app the contact numbers of some his/her relatives will be taken.
* Bullet list
The similar SMS alert will be sent to them too so that they will be aware of the danger and contact for help.
* Bullet list
The alert will also be sent to nearby rescue teams along with the loccation so that suitable action action can be taken.

# 3. Finding the Missing People
* Bullet list
Suppose someone is stuck in a calamity and his family is not aware of it then they can use the app to know about it.
* Bullet list
They can upload the details of the missing person to check whether the person was recently stuck in a calamity.
