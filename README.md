# codefundo_project
Our idea is to build a mobile app.

# Features:
# 1. Prediction:
-The data about the natural disaster will be fed to the app.
-That data will be used for training and getting a learned model.
-The users locations will be accesses by the GPS available on the mobile.
-The data from online news will be used as a test data for the model to predict whether the user's current location is prone to any kind of natural calamity.
-The online weather forecast will be taken into consideration. 

# 2. Alert:
-Once the prediction is positive the user will get an SMS alert of the danger.
-Some measures will also be given to the user for safety.
-Before the user starts using the app the contact numbers of some his/her relatives will be taken.
-The similar SMS alert will be sent to them too so that they will be aware of the danger and contact for help.
-The alert will also be sent to nearby rescue teams along with the loccation so that suitable action action can be taken.

# 3. Finding the Missing People
-Suppose someone is stuck in a calamity and his family is not aware of it then they can use the app to know about it.
-They can upload the details of the missing person to check whether the person was recently stuck in a calamity.
