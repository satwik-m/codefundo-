## Our idea is to build a mobile app for disaster management during tsunamis. ##

# Features:
# 1. Prediction:
The data available about the natural disaster will be fed to the app.
That data will be used for training and getting a learned model.
The data from online news,satellite info and other sources will be used as a test data for the model to predict whether the user's current location is prone to any kind of natural disaster.
The online weather forecast will also be taken into consideration,incase that was detected earlier.
The user is notified about these alerts, their probability, source etc.

# 2. Alert and Rescue:
Once the prediction is positive the user will get an SMS alert of the danger.
The govt is also provided with the data so that some rescue measures might be taken in advance and these measures are collected by the app.
The user is notified about these rescue operations.
The alert will also be sent to the selected contacts provide by the user in advance.
If some user is caught in the disaster, he/she can request(location info through GPS) for help using the app and the nearby rescue teams are informed about this. 

# 3. Finding the Missing People
The information about the missing people can be fed into the app, so that the rescue team can find them and contact those users.
Also, the info regarding the people found is also kept, so that any of their relatives can locate them.
